CLINICALTRIALS.GOV SCRAPER PROBLEMS & TODO
==========================================


1. Fucked up text formatting for 'Purposes' when these have paragraphs (<p>)
   or lists (<li>) in them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Locations not scraped because of their html formatting. Fix get_study()
   function so that it scrapes the locations from the urls listed below.
   At the moment the function is returning an empty locations list for these
   urls.

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01776424?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 11
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01764633?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 19
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01261273?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 26
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01468701?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 28
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01991795?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 32
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01945268?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 38
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01858532?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 39 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01574703?show_locs=Y#locn  # Rank 44

This happens when locations specify if that particular location
is recruiting or isn't. It apparently only happens with studies that
are currently recruiting or not yet recruiting.

Studies rank 46, 47, 48, 50 and 52 are also problematic. Rank numbers refer to
the enumeration of the results returned by the search url defined (variable
"SEARCH_URL") at the top of scrape.py.

4. Make the script itself store the data in a file (whose name is given as an
   argument from the command line) instead of redirecting stdout when calling
   the script. That way when the script is running it can print its progress
   without affecting the final output.
