CLINICALTRIALS.GOV SCRAPER PROBLEMS & TODO
==========================================


1. Fucked up text formatting for 'Purposes' when these have paragraphs (<p>)
   or lists (<li>) in them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Make the script itself store the data in a file (whose name is given as an
   argument from the command line) instead of redirecting stdout when calling
   the script. That way when the script is running it can print its progress
   without affecting the final output.
